According to python's grammar, I designed this PY0 language by C++ as Fundamentals of Compiling course final project. It is a interpreted language, therefore, it is not efficient at all. But by reading the source code of this program, I hope reader could have a better understanding of the compiling process.

grammar.txt in this folder show the basic grammar of this language, while symbol.txt show the reserved word. Demonstrate.pptx is the my project overview, and report.pdf is the detail of my project.
